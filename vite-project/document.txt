implementing cron jobs for email analytics
applying ml model for future prediction of growth
got the insta statistics api to fetch all the relevant information
before that tried to hit a normal api to get followers growth using this
the api will be deployed on cloud and a timer will be set to hit the api at particular time and store the data at that time in the database and plot relevant graph related to it
